Information regarding tidy data

# Data Description
Tidy data contains the average of mean and standard deviation related measurement for each activity and each subject. It is the final output from the full data set described in ReadMe.MD.

Tidy data includes 180 observation (30 subjects x 6 measuring activities) with 68 varaibles, which list as below with the column order.
